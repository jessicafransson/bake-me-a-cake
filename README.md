## Design

The look of this project is inspired by Code Institutes "I think therefor I blog" project and swedish pastry Queen Camilla Hamid. Find her live website [here] (https://mykitchenstories.se/)

### Color Scheeme 
- I wanted to keep this website basic and easy to navigate. The color of header and footer is taken from Camilla Hamid, but text is altered to a black-ish color to update the accessibility score. 
- I also want to make sure that the images from the recipes pop-out, as users can add any image. 

### Images
- The images has been taken from pixabay that is currently displayed on the project, future images will be uploaded by various users. 














**I've used Figma to mock-up design, I've used CRUD and used project planning with my to-do list.** 

**Why have you added this script?**
For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.
